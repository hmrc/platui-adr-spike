**In the context of** the need to record architecture decisions,  
**facing** a lack of understanding of what decisions were made in the past and why, causing
misunderstandings, confusion for new starters and friction on the team  
**we decided for** Y-Statements  
**and neglected** MADR and Nygard's ADRs,  
**to achieve** a lightweight method for recording decisions,  
**accepting** a lack of tooling, structure to aid readability, long sentences,
standardised method for storing.
